1.8.0-beta.1
============

* The Almond platform was updated to the 1.8 series [#54].
* The wake word implementation was changed to snowboy. This reduced the app
  on-disk footprint, and made the app easier to install. As part of this
  change, the wake word is now "computer" [#53].
* The speech-to-text backend was changed and now uses Microsoft Speech API,
  significantly improving the voice quality [#53].

1.7.3
=====

* Almond can now run on Windows as a native application (without
  WSL or docker). This should improve development of Almond on Windows [#45].
* Updated dependencies. In particular, this brings new support for
  customizable temperature units. For now, this must be configured
  manually. A UI will be added in the future [#40, #48].

1.7.2
=====

* Updated dependencies

1.7.1
=====

* The main conversation is now delayed until the page is opened
  if speech is not available, allowing to show the welcome screen
* Updated dependencies

1.7.0

This is the first stable release of almond-server, the single-user
home server version of Almond. The version number is chosen to align
with the rest of the Almond platform.
